This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera settings.  When attempting to access the camera's output using `cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync()`, the promise consistently rejects with an error, `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync')`. This happens despite the camera apparently initializing correctly and displaying the preview successfully.  The issue is intermittent and doesn't have consistent repro steps.
