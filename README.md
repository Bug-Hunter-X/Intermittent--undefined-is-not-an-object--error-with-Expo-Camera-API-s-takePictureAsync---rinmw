# Expo Camera takePictureAsync() Intermittent Error

This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync()` method.  The camera preview displays correctly, but the `takePictureAsync()` promise rejects with an `undefined is not an object` error.  The root cause appears to be related to asynchronous operations and timing issues within the Expo Camera component, but the exact trigger remains elusive.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing this bug is inconsistent.  Attempts to create precise steps have been unsuccessful.  The bug seems to appear randomly after numerous uses of the camera or after background processes on the device. 

## Solution

The provided solution involves adding error handling and a retry mechanism to mitigate the problem. The retry mechanism attempts to capture the image multiple times before giving up, handling the rejection and returning an error gracefully.  It is not a perfect solution, but it makes the application more robust against the intermittent failure.
